; A directed don't care up (a*) must not be followed by an rising edge (a+).
; It is not always obvious whether a* is a ddc up or ddc down. In this 
; example a* is a ddc down, because it is preceeded by an 'a+' so a enters
; state 1 with a logic high. 'a*' must be a ddc down, because it might
; either stay high or might go down to zero. In any case, one can not 
; expect a rising edge 'a+' ...
